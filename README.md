# Investigate a Dataset

This project involves working with a huge dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) with around 100,000 rows using pandas. It parses and cleans through the data and displays some charts to answer several research questions.

Pandas was used over manual parsing or SQL as it's by far the fastest out of those options and any other.

## Usage

This repository has the raw csv file within it so all that's needed is to have it in the same directory as the ipynb file and the code will run smoothly.
